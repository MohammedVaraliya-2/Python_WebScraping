# Property Detail Scraper

## Problem Statement

**Task 2: Web Scraping Script**
**Objective:**
Create a Python script to scrape data from the website
(https://www.realestate.com.au/).

**Requirements:**

1. **Search Functionality:** - When 'Epping' is typed in the search URL, the script should fetch the details of properties listed.
2. **Property Details:** - The script should scrape information about each property, such as price, address, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, agent details and other relevant details.
3. **Output:** - The scraped data should be saved in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
4. **Technologies:** - Use Python for the script. - You can use libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium.
5. **Documentation:** - Provide detailed documentation of your code and implementation process.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required packages by running:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Execution**: Run the `domain_web_scraping.py` script:

   ```
   python automation.py
   ```

3. **Output**: After successful execution, the script will generate `property_details.xlsx` files, each containing product information. You can analyze this data to gain insights into the particular property.
